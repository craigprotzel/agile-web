Course Description
------------------
Agile Web is a production based course that will introduce students to the fundamentals of creating media for the web. With basic web development as a consistent backbone to the course, students will be exposed to a range of mediums and technologies including 2D design, digital imaging, sound, video, animation, and effects. The forms and uses of these communications technologies are explored in a laboratory context of experimentation, collaboration, and discussion. Course material will build upon itself with the hope and expectation that students will leverage each project to create the next one. Fundamentals of creative storytelling will be emphasized throughout with an ultimate goal of creating compelling content in the context of the web. The course will be fast-paced and embrace the "agile" philisophy of quick, collabrorative, and incremental workflow.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------
* Develop a fundamental skill set for creating a range of web + media content
* Learn how to design and develop basic web-based interactions using fundamental web technologies, primarily HTML, CSS and javascript.
* Gain experience and confidence working with media production equipment and software 
* Learn how to leverage production processes to take an idea and make it come to life
* Develop an understanding of storytelling fundamentals, user-experience, and web design
* Gain experience collaborating with others in both creative and technical processes

Teaching Methodology
--------------------
This course takes an active learning project-oriented approach offering students as much hands ­on experience as possible. Classes will move quickly through each technology offering both a theoretical foundation and technical instruction. Working examples will either be provided or created together in class. The material and assignments will build incrementally with each project leveraging the work from the previous one.

Students will be encouraged to learn through play, experimentation, collaboration, and exploration. Individual classes will include lectures, discussions, examples, workshops, group work, and presentations. Outside of the class, students will engage in both individual and group work. Group collaboration is a fundamental component of this course.

Attendance & Participation
--------------------------
* Attendance is mandatory. Every class builds off the previous one so it is vital to be present for every lesson. Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will negatively impact your final grade for the class. If you know you are going to be late or absent, please email me in advance. If you have an emergency, please let me know as soon as you can.
* Each unexcused absences (more than 20 minutes late to class) will result in a lower final grade (i.e. B+ to B). More than two unexcused absences will result in an F.
* Showing up on time, engaging in the class discussion, and offering advice and input during class is a major part of your grade. Participating in class is helpful for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your progress, but most importantly, it provides you and your classmates the opportunity to share failures, successes, and insights on the work you are doing.
* Please turn in all assignments on time. For each day an assignment is late, it will result in a lower final grade (i.e. B+ to B).
* You are expected to show work in class. Explaining your work to other people is a great way to better understand the material and answer questions for yourself.
* Be prepared to work with a partner or in groups on the assignments.
* Ask questions. If you do not ask questions, I can only assume you understand the material completely.

Laptops
-------
Laptop use will be expected in class, but should be focused on class-specific material, applications, and research. Whenever classmates are presenting please keep your laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part on your attention and active participation, so please respect your fellow classmates and close your lid.

Mobile Phones
-------------
 Please put them on vibrate or turn them off before you come to class. If you have an emergency that requires you to answer your phone during class, please let me know me ahead of time or quietly step out of class to take the call.

Communicate
-----------
If you have any questions, would like extra help or need further instruction please reach out to me. You can communicate with me via e-mail, sign up for ofice hours, speak with me before class, after class or during break, but please let me know if you have any concerns pertaining to the course.
