#### 2: Sounds Like
Create an "original" audio web experience. You may use any audio you like. It could be entirely new sound that you record or it could be sound you find online and download.  Regardless of the source, a user should be able to engage with the sound(s) in an interesting and compelling way. Examples of approaches include telling a story with sound, layering sounds, effecting sounds, or even sonifying data. Your project should include a .html file, a .css file, a .js file, and any necessary media.
